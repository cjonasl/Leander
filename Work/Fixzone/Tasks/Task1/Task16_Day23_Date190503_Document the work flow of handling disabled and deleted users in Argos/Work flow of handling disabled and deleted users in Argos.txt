Work flow of handling disabled and deleted users in Argos

Step 1:
Stored procedure "DisableUsers" is run by a scheduler (VisualCron)
which disables users that have been inactive for more than 90 days
(UserWeb.Enabled is set to 0 and DisabledDate is set to execution date).
The scheduler should run the stored proicedure once a day and I think
around 01:00 am is a good time.

Step 2:
Directly after the scheduler has run stored procedure "DisableUsers"
the scheduler then runs stored procedure "DeleteUsers" which deletes
users that have been disabled for more than 30 days and move them to
table DeletedUserWebRecordsSinceLastReport.

Step 3:
On a regular basis stored procedure "GenerateReportDisabledDeletedUsers"
is manually run to generate a report of disabled and deleted users
(since last time a report was generated).

Step 4:
The stored procedure "DeleteTmpStoredDeletedUsers" is manually run to delete
all rows in table DeletedUserWebRecordsSinceLastReport.
